If you require further information regarding our legitimate interests as applied to your personal information, you may contact us at privacy@veltmon.com.</p>

<p>The Services are for individuals who are at least 18 years of age. The Services are not designed to be used by individuals under the age of 18.</p>

<p>In certain circumstances, if you do not provide personal information which is required, we will not be able to perform our obligations under the contract with you or may not be able to provide you with products and services. We will make it clear if and when this situation arises and what the consequences of not providing the information will be.</p>

<p>If you access the Restricted Areas of any of our Services, we may collect information about your access to and use of research materials, decision-support tools, and other online and offline resources we offer.</p>

<p>We may also periodically obtain information about you from other sources. The collection of such information will be in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Examples of information we receive include updated contact information and additional demographic information. Please note that we sometimes collect information relating to you at the time you or your company enrol in a program run by Veltmon or any of its partners, as well as in the course of allocating and issuing to you a unique ID and password to access any Restricted Areas of the services.</p>

<br><br>
<p><strong>2.  WHEN WE DISCLOSE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>


<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties as follows:
  <p>
<li>To Veltmon in order to process the data for the above mentioned purposes;
When we have your consent or authorization to do so;</li>
<li>To third parties who work on our behalf to service or maintain business contact databases and other IT systems, such as suppliers of the IT systems which we use to process personal information, or who provide other technical services, such as printing;</li>
<li>To third parties providing services to us who have a need to access your information, such as our professional advisors (e.g. auditors and lawyers);</li>
<li>To comply with applicable laws, protect rights, safety and property, and respond to lawful requests from public authorities (such as disclosing data in appropriate situations for national security or law enforcement purposes);</li>
<li>Subject to applicable law, in the event that Veltmon is merged or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets (including in bankruptcy), or in the event of another corporate change, in connection with such a transaction, or for pre-transaction review in relation to such transactions.</li>

</p>
<p>Your personal information may be shared if we anonymize and/or aggregate it, as in these circumstances the information will cease to be personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Utilization Information</p></strong>
<p>We may share information with our organizational clients about how their employees use the resources available to them through the Services (e.g. reports downloaded, events attended, newsletters subscribed too, projects requested/provided, and quotes).

<br><br>
<p><strong>3.  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>


<p>We may transfer personal information to other partners or suppliers outside your home jurisdiction. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected and any such transfers comply with applicable law.
<p>Veltmon may transfer and maintain the personal information of individuals covered by this Policy on servers or databases outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Some of these countries may not have the equivalent level of protection under their data protection laws as in the EEA.
<br><br> 
<p><strong>4.  RETENTION PERIODS</strong></p>

<p>We will retain your personal information for as long as required to perform the purposes for which the data was collected, depending on the legal basis for which that data was obtained and/or whether additional legal/regulatory obligations mandate that we retain your personal information. We may also retain personal information for the period during which a claim may be made in relation to our dealings with you.</p>
<p>In general terms, this will mean that your personal information will be kept for the duration of our relationship with you and:</p>
<li>the period required by tax and company laws and regulations; and
<li>as long as it is necessary for you to be able to bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves against any legal claims. This will generally be the length of the relationship plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period under local laws.
</p>
<br><br>
<p><strong>5. CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We believe it is important to give you choices about the use of your information. We will use your information as described in this Policy (or any other event- or service-specific privacy policy). If we want to use your information for a purpose not described in this Policy, we will first get your consent to do so.

<p><strong>Marketing Communications</p></strong>

<p>We will respect your wishes not to receive marketing communications. You can change your marketing preferences by contacting us at the address privacy@veltmon.com. If you gave us your email address to receive marketing communications, you can opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe links or instructions included at the bottom of our emails. Please note that we will continue to send you service-related communications regardless of any opt-out request. We will not sell or share your information or information with third parties (other than our subsidiaries or affiliates) for their own promotional or marketing purposes unless you give us consent to do so and where permitted by applicable law.</p>

<br><br> 
<p><strong>6. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</strong></p>


<p>You have certain rights, in certain circumstances, in relation to your personal information. A summary of each right and how an individual can take steps to exercise it is set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details specified above. Such requests should include appropriate identity verification information (such as your name, cellphone number, address, email address or other information reasonably required).</p>

<p>Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we shall provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example where requests are complex or numerous.</p>

<p>The information will be provided free of charge, except where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character. In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request. We will advise you of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.</p>

<p>We may ask for additional information to verify your identity before carrying out a request.</p>

<p>Where we do not carry out a request, we shall inform you without delay and within one month of receipt of the request, providing our reasons for not taking the action requested.</p>


<p><strong>Right to access and/or correct your personal information</strong></p>

You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, as well as to be provided with a copy of the information (in most circumstances). You also have the right to correct any information we may hold about you that is inaccurate. </p>


<p><strong>Right to restrict use of your personal information</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:</p>

<li>The processing is unlawful but you want us to restrict use of the data instead of deleting it;
<li>Where you contest the accuracy of your personal information, the restriction will apply until we have verified the accuracy or corrected your personal information;
<li>We no longer require the personal information for the purposes of processing, but you still require us to keep it in connection with a legal claim; or
<li>You have exercised your right to object to the processing.

<p>Any restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.</p>


<p><strong>Right to request deletion of your personal information</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information in certain circumstances. Please note that if you want us to refrain from sending you marketing communications, you may do so by following the instructions in Section 5 (Choices About Your Information) above.</p>

<p>There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal information is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>


<p><strong>Right to object to processing of your personal information</strong></p>

<p>You may object to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>You may also object to processing of your personal information in cases where we have used legitimate interests as the basis for processing. In such cases, we will stop processing your personal information until we verify that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms in asking us to stop processing the data, or in limited cases where we need to continue processing the data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.</p>

<p><strong>Right to data portability</strong></p>

<p>In most cases, you have the right to receive all personal information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this data to another data controller, where technically feasible.</p>

<p>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority If you object to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to complain to the data protection authority (“DPA”) in the country where you reside, where you work, or where an alleged infringement of data protection laws has taken place.</p>

<br><br>
<p><strong>7. SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access. Despite these measures, no data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit via the Services. Please note that you must report suspected unauthorized activity to us.</p>

<p>We make efforts to restrict access to information to only those employees, contractors, partners and agents who need such access in order to operate, develop, improve, or deliver our programs, products, and services.</p>

<br><br>
<p><strong>8.  COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>

<p>A cookie is a small text file which includes a unique identifier that is sent by a web server to the browser on your computer, mobile phone or any other internet enabled device when you visit an on-line site. Cookies and similar technologies are widely used to make websites work efficiently and to collect information about your online preferences. For simplicity, we refer to all these technologies as “cookies”.</p>

<p>Some of our website pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, tags or pixels) that allow us to count users who have visited our pages. Web beacons collect only limited information, e.g. a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. We may also carry web beacons placed by third party advertisers. These beacons do not carry any information that could directly identify you.</p>

<p>More detailed information on how we use cookies and other web technologies can be found <a href="cookie-policy.html">here</a>
 
<br><br>
<p><strong>9.  MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Links</strong></p>

<p>To provide increased value to you, we provide links to other websites or resources that are not part of the Services run by Veltmon. We do not control these websites or their privacy practices, and any information you provide to these sites is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and not this Policy.</p>

<p><strong>9.2 Changes to this Policy</strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may change and/or update this Policy. If this Policy changes in any way, we will post an updated version on this website. We recommend you regularly review this website to ensure that you are always aware of our information practices and any changes to such. Any changes to this Policy will go into effect on posting to this page.</p>
